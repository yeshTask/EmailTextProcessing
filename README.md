# Email Text Analysis

This does Natural Language toolkit analysis to read the words in your email inbox and list the phrases and the number of times it is occurred. 
It plots a graph with pie-chart to interpret and visualise the results. All the messages from inbox is extracted, analysed, processed and transformed
to find the phrases and finally sort and list them. Have considered simple gmail auth by allowing access to less secure apps for this process,but the
best way is to create a app token and use that for authentication.
